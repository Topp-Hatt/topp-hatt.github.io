			<img src="img/ryan-pic2.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Ryan Lowe" class="bio-pic" /><p>Hello, my name is Ryan Lowe. I am a 24 year old student of Eastern Washington University majoring in English with an emphasis on Creative Writing and minoring in Design. My likes include board gaming and computer gaming of all kinds.</p>
        	<p>I was born in Sacramento, California, but our family (which includes my parents, my sister Nicky, and our various pets) has moved around a lot. Besides California, I've lived in Richland, Washington; Corvallis, Oregon; Kettering, Ohio and Kennewick, Washington. At the moment, I'm living in Spokane and commuting to EWU.</p>
        	<p>My long term goal is to go into publishing, either as an editor or a designer. My hope is that by learning the ins and outs of the industry, knowledge which I can then utilize in a career as a fiction writer.</p>
